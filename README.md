# Light Calculations

An expansion upon the point-clouds repo, this project reads in an .obj file, and renders it in a space with three different types of light: point, directional, and spotlight. 

<b>Controls</b>:

Holding down the left mouse button and moving it will rotate the object using trackball rotation.

Holding down the right mouse button will translate the model to a point near the cursor. 

The mouse wheel will zoom in and out in regards to the model. 

The s/S keys will scale the model in size. 

r/R will reset the model and lights (respectively) to the origin.

0 will disable light control mode.

1 will enable controls for the directional light.

2 will enable controls for the point light.

3 will enable controls for the spot light.

E while spot is active will modify the spotlight exponent modifier.

o/O will orbit the model about the z-axis. 

x/X, y/Y, z/Z will move the object in its respective axis. 

F1 loads the bunny model.

F2 loads the dragon model.

F3 loads the bear model (omitted because of size).
